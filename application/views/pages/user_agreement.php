  <strong>Buyers:</strong> The users who shall post &quot;offer requirement&quot; on our website or hire the &quot;freelancers&quot; or &quot;sellers&quot; through our website by:</b><br /><br />
  <ul><li>Clicking on the &quot;Hire Me&quot; button next to the profile of the wedding professional freelancer directly.</li> <br>
 <li> Posting a &quot;Job&quot; on the website requiring the wedding planners, venues, florists or other professionals to send their &quot;bids&quot; or &quot;offers&quot; to the requirements and then by selecting one of them.</li> <br>
  <li>The buyers must provide enough details and &quot;bid range&quot; while posting the offer requirement.</li><br>
  <li>Sellers or Wedding Freelancers: The users who will be hired by the buyers through the &quot;hire me&quot; button or who will post bid or offers for the &quot;offer requirements&quot; or who will offer their wedding related services and products through our website shall be termed as Sellers of Freelancers.</li></ul> <br>
  The moment buyer accepts the bid posted by the seller on the &quot;offer requirement&quot; posted by the buyer and the seller accepts the same, a user agreement shall be deemed to have been signed between the buyer and the seller.

  At no point of time, a joint venture, partnership or any other class of right apart from that of independent contractor shall exist between the buyer and the seller. Both parties shall be solely responsible to fight their legal claims against each other in accordance with the dispute resolution policy given below. </p><br><br>
<h4 class="subheading"><strong>ESCROW ACCOUNT </strong></h4>
  <p>When a bid or offer is accepted by the buyer, we require him to pay the total bid amount to us which shall be kept in a separate account with us till the project is completed. Once the buyer confirms to us that the work has been completed by the seller, we shall release the payment to the seller's account after deducting our commissions and charges as explained below.
  With the consent of the buyer, the seller may ask for an advance payment of 25% from the total amount deposited by the buyer.
  The buyer may also opt for periodic payments or contingent payments by which successive installments of the amount will be released to the seller at completion of certain &quot;milestones&quot; or &quot;tasks&quot; of certain percentage of the total work allotted, as notified in the &quot;offer requirement&quot; or as &quot;negotiated by the users&quot;.
