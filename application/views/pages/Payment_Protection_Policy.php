  Payment Protection Policy
</h2>  
  <hr class="line">
  b4thewedding's Payment Protection Policy helps ensure Clients pay only for work that has been completed and approved. Clients have the ability to inspect work previously agreed upon and delivered by their particular wedding contractor, before they release funds from Escrow.<br><br>

<ul><li>Clients award their desired wedding project to their contractor and both parties agree to their Terms and Milestones set for the job. If the project is complex or takes more than 3 weeks, setting up multiple Milestones is recommended. </li><br>
  <li>If more than one Milestone is set for a particular project, Contractors should request the Client fund Escrow for the first Milestone at a minimum. Though not required, clients can also fund escrow for all of their Milestones when a project begins. </li> <br>
 <li> Service providing contractors payment preference may vary depending on the contractor and the type of service being provided. Any changes to the project details/milestone must be approved by both sides. If not agreed by both sides, the first milestone will stay valid. Payment protection is provided on details provided within terms of service and milestones.
</li><br>
  <li>b4thewedding Escrow Payment Protection helps ensure funds are available prior to Contractors starting work. Project Milestones are set and funded by the Client using b4thewedding Escrow. If Terms and job Milestones are met, payment to the Contractor is secured. </li><br>
